# project-2-wdi

For our second project we were given 6 days to design and build an app using HTML, JS, CSS and NODEJS.
I wanted to create a website that would allow artists to showcase their portfolio, and other users to be able to contact them.


#Current Features

The users are able to register, log in, and create their personal profile on the page.

Upon logging in to the site, the user is able to setup a page for their artworks and like other users creation.

The user can upload, edit and delete their own artwork.

In order to do so I wanted to give users tools to be able to design their profile and portfolio to their needs and desires, which is why I used a medium-editor. To allow for markdown styling.

#Planned features

I would like to add the ability for the user that commissioned the artwork, to be able to leave feedback when it is uploaded to the site.
I would like there to be a rating system, for both artwork and artists and users commissioning them, so other users can see which artist, or commissioning user is trustworthy and a joy to work with.
A search function, to be able to browse through only specific types of images or artists, to narrow down or broaden your search.
A message system, so users wouldn't have to resort to using personal emails for their deals.

#Complications during development

I found NodeJS to be incredibly complicated initially, it was definitely a learning process through the entire project. Similarily, using frameworks, such as Bulma, whilst userful I do find them at times to be a hindrance as much as they make the process of development easier in other regards

#In review

Overall, I'm pleased with what I was able to create in the span of the time we were given, I definitely learned much about NodeJS. I was surprised initially to see how easy it is to feature-bloat my own creation in the planning stages, before I was able to get any code down. But thanks to having it planned out and prioritised the features accordingly I was able to remove features that would've been nice to haves rather than must-haves.
